Getting Started
---------------

To get started, you'll need to get familiar with [Source Control Tools](https://source.android.com/setup/develop).

To initialize your local repository using this kleaf build tree, use a command like this:
```
repo init -u https://github.com/Tortel/shusky-kernel-manifest.git -b lineage-21 --git-lfs
```
Then to sync up:
```
repo sync
```
